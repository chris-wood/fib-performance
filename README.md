# FIB data structures

Algorithms:
- Naive hash table [done]
- (hash table - Cisco) So et al. [done]
- (patricia trie with name compression) Song et al. [in proress]
- (bloom filter with hash table (or bloom filter list) - Caesar) Perino et al. [done]
- (merged bloom filter) Dong et al. [done]

# Experiments
- For each hash-based FIB, compare the lookup times for hashed vs non-hashed names [done]
- For trie-based FIBs, compare the lookup times against hash-based FIBs with hashed and non-hashed names [done]
